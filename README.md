# Clustering-and-Topic-Modeling
Clustered songs data (based on lyrics) and analyzed the topic to which each document (or the song) belongs to based on the textual lyrics using data modeling techniques.

### 1. Creating an Environment
##### a. Load datasets
##### b. Vectorize with tf-idf vectorization
### 2. K-Means Clustering – Trial Run
##### a. Perform k-means with 3 clusters
##### b. Identify top 5 closest documents to each cluster’s centroid
### 3. Dimensionality Reduction
##### a. Reduce Dimension to 50 components using LSA
##### b. Identify the top five features per component
### 4. Clustering on Low Dimension Features
##### a. Perform K-means for 2-10 clusters
##### b. Identify the optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method
##### c. Find top five closest documents to each cluster’s centroid
### 5. Dimensionality Reduction
##### a. Reduce Dimension to 2 components
##### b. Identify three clusters in data
##### c. Plot the clusters using scatterplot
